# Automate-a-process-to-inject-a-.MP4-file-with-a-spatial-media-file
To automate the process of importing an .MP4 file into a GitHub tool and injecting it with a spatial media file (to enable 360-degree video playback), you'll need to follow a few steps. Below is a high-level plan and a sample tool implementation for this process, assuming you're using a GitHub repository with a tool to inject the required spatial media metadata into the .MP4 file.
Steps Overview:

    Extract Metadata from the .MP4 Video:
        The video file should be processed to inject metadata that indicates it is a 360-degree video. This is typically done by adding special spatial media tags to the file header.

    Inject Spatial Media Metadata:
        The metadata injected into the .MP4 file tells media players (like YouTube or Vimeo) that the video is 360-degree. This is typically a spherical video tag.

    Automating the Process:
        This can be done using a script that automates the steps: processing the .MP4 file, adding the metadata, and saving the updated file.

    Exporting:
        Once injected, you can export the .MP4 file for sharing, uploading to GitHub, or further use.

Tools & Technologies:

    FFmpeg:
        A powerful open-source tool for handling video and audio files. We will use FFmpeg to inject spatial media metadata into the .MP4 file.

    GitHub API:
        To automate the process of uploading the video to a GitHub repository.

    Python or Shell Script:
        The script can automate the whole process, from accepting an .MP4 file to injecting the metadata and uploading the result to GitHub.

Step 1: Inject Spatial Media Metadata (FFmpeg)

You need to add metadata to your .MP4 video file to indicate that it's a 360-degree video. FFmpeg has the capability to add metadata tags. Here's how to use FFmpeg to inject spatial media metadata into a video file:

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -map_metadata -1 -metadata:s:v:0 "stereo3d=sidebyside" -metadata "spherical=1" output_360.mp4

Explanation:

    -metadata:s:v:0 "stereo3d=sidebyside": Adds metadata indicating the 3D stereoscopic format (side-by-side in this case).
    -metadata "spherical=1": Tells the player that this is a spherical (360-degree) video.
    -c copy: Copies the video codec without re-encoding (faster processing).
    -map_metadata -1: Ensures the original metadata is not copied over.

Step 2: Upload Video to GitHub

For this step, we'll use GitHub's API to upload the .MP4 video file into a GitHub repository. You can use Python with the requests library to interact with the GitHub API.

Install the required libraries:

pip install requests

Python script to upload to GitHub:

import os
import requests
from base64 import b64encode

# GitHub credentials and repo details
GITHUB_API_URL = "https://api.github.com"
GITHUB_TOKEN = "YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
REPO_OWNER = "your-username"
REPO_NAME = "your-repo"
FILE_PATH = "path_to_your_video/output_360.mp4"
GITHUB_FILE_PATH = "path/in/repo/output_360.mp4"

# Function to upload a file to GitHub
def upload_to_github(file_path, file_name, repo_owner, repo_name):
    # Read the file and encode it in base64
    with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
        file_content = b64encode(file.read()).decode("utf-8")

    # Prepare the API request payload
    url = f"{GITHUB_API_URL}/repos/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}/contents/{file_name}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"token {GITHUB_TOKEN}",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"
    }
    payload = {
        "message": "Adding 360-degree video",
        "content": file_content,
        "branch": "main"  # Or any other branch where you want to upload the file
    }

    # Make the API request to upload the file
    response = requests.put(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

    if response.status_code == 201:
        print("File uploaded successfully")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to upload file: {response.content}")

# Upload the video
upload_to_github(FILE_PATH, GITHUB_FILE_PATH, REPO_OWNER, REPO_NAME)

Step 3: Combine Everything Into an Automated Tool

You can create a Python tool or shell script to automate the entire process of:

    Accepting an .MP4 file as input.
    Running the FFmpeg command to inject the 360-degree metadata.
    Uploading the .MP4 file to GitHub.

Here's a simple outline for the automation:

import subprocess

# Step 1: Inject Spatial Media Metadata (FFmpeg)
def inject_spatial_metadata(input_file, output_file):
    command = [
        "ffmpeg", 
        "-i", input_file, 
        "-c", "copy", 
        "-map_metadata", "-1", 
        "-metadata:s:v:0", "stereo3d=sidebyside", 
        "-metadata", "spherical=1", 
        output_file
    ]
    subprocess.run(command)

# Step 2: Upload to GitHub (same as above)
def upload_to_github(file_path, file_name, repo_owner, repo_name):
    # Same function as provided in the previous step
    pass

# Main automation script
def main():
    input_video = "path_to_input_video/input.mp4"
    output_video = "path_to_output_video/output_360.mp4"
    
    # Inject metadata into the .MP4 file
    inject_spatial_metadata(input_video, output_video)
    
    # Upload the updated .MP4 to GitHub
    upload_to_github(output_video, "path/in/repo/output_360.mp4", "your-username", "your-repo")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Running the Tool

    Place your .MP4 file in the input_video path.
    Run the script. It will:
        Inject spatial metadata to make it a 360-degree video.
        Upload the video to your specified GitHub repository.

Conclusion

This approach automates the process of injecting 360-degree video metadata into an .MP4 file using FFmpeg, and then uploads the processed video to GitHub using the GitHub API.

You can customize the scripts further as per your requirements, such as adding additional metadata, handling errors, or making the process more flexible.
